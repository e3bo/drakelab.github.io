This is the first official post of the Drake lab blog! We are a mixed groups of disease, population, and community ecologists all sharing a similar love of computers and the computational fruits they can offer. Posts on this blog will center on problems that we've encountered, and how we overcame them, as a means to communicate how others can bypass our mistakes.
