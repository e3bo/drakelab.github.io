Welcome to the Drake lab blog. We are a part of the [Odum School of Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu) at the [University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu). Our interests are diverse, but deal generally with the population and community ecology of infectious disease. For information on lab projects, see our [website](http://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/). This blog serves as a platform for sharing useful code, and methods to overcome common problems that we've faced.



This blog was created on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, templating from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com),and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/taddallas).


Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact us, or report an issue on Github.

Thanks for reading!
